There is a fine gold goblet at the center of a
runic triangle on the floor.
You try to take the goblet, but your hand
passes through it as if it were illusory.

You notice a glowing orb, labeled orb1, in one
corner of the triangle. The other points of the 
triangle are labeled orb2 and orb3, but the orbs 
have long since been stolen by tomb raiders.

Perhaps adding more orbs would free the goblet's 
material form.

You can cast this spell to create the second orb from the first orb

$ cp orb1 orb2

Now you have the power to complete the triangle by creating orb3.
Go ahead and cast your spell.
